## Motivation (Command pattern)

The command pattern is sometimes called a service object, an operation, an action, and probably more names that Iâ€™m not aware of. Whatever the name we gave it, the purpose of such a pattern is rather simple: take a business action and put it behind an object with a simple interface.

## Usage

### Forms

``` ruby

require 'redress/form'

class ApplicationForm < Redress::Form
end
```

Let's define simple form:

``` ruby
class SimpleForm < ApplicationForm
  mimic :user

  schema do
    attribute :name, String
    attribute :email, String
    attribute :name_with_email, String
  end

  validates :name, presence: true
  validates :email, presence: true

  def map_model(user)
    self.name_with_email = "#{user.name} <#{user.email}>"
  end
end
```

### Commands

``` ruby
# app/commands/application_command.rb
require 'redress/form'

class ApplicationCommand < Redress::Commad
end
```

Or if you are using ActiveRecord:

``` ruby
# app/commands/application_command.rb
require 'redress/form'

class ApplicationCommand < Redress::Commad
  def transaction(&block)
    ActiveRecord::Base.transaction(&block) if block_given?
  end
end
```

    bundle exec rspec ./spec/
